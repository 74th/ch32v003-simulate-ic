# CH32V003 IC Simulation

This project aims to simulate the functionality of various common integrated circuits (ICs), starting with the MCP23017 I2C GPIO expander, using a CH32V003 microcontroller.  This is a hobby project and is provided as-is.

> [!Caution]
> This project is experimental and intended for hobby use and learning purposes only.  It is NOT recommended for production or commercial applications. For mission-critical or commercial deployments, it is strongly advised to use genuine ICs. These simulations may not fully replicate all features and behaviors of the original chips and could have limitations in terms of timing, stability, and power consumption.  Use at your own risk.
